# Crop Production Analysis: Ghana MOFA 2013 Dataset

I created this project to showcase my foundational SQL skills while exploring agricultural trends in Ghana. Using real data from Ghana's Ministry of Food and Agriculture, I performed data cleaning and analysis to uncover production trends for key crops between 2000-2012.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning**: Fixed column headers, handled missing values, standardized crop names
- **Database Management**: Created tables and imported data
- **Data Analysis**: Used aggregate functions, filtering, and sorting
- **Trend Analysis**: Identified production patterns over time
- **Problem Solving**: Addressed real-world data inconsistencies

## Key Insights
- Cassava production consistently dominated other crops
- Cocoyam showed a concerning 5-year decline
- Yam production grew by 97% from 2000-2012
- 2007 was a difficult year for multiple crops

## Data Storytelling Highlights
Through SQL analysis, I uncovered Ghana's agricultural narrative:
- **Cassava's Dominance**: Became Ghana's undisputed crop leader with consistent growth
- **The 2007 Crisis**: Revealed how floods devastated northern crops like sorghum
- **Yam Revolution**: Discovered 97% production surge over 12 years
- **Cocoyam Decline**: Identified a worrying 22% production drop
- **Future Trends**: Projected cassava's accelerating growth pattern
